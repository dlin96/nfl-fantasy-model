## purpose
The idea behind this project is to create a blog space where people (namely my friends and I) can post our amateur analysis (using whatever data and analysis techniques) of sports. This project started off with a player comparison functionality, but I realized my friends and I would spend way too much time arguing over sports and compiling stats from various online sources. I felt that this would be a good way for us to keep a record and also act as a "Player's Tribune" of sorts but for amateur sports viewers.
